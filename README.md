This repository contains the stimuli generation and experiment code used in a study of 
the effect of spatial frequency and stimulus complexity on mental imagery vividness. 
The experiment stimuli consisted of gabors of varying spatial frequency and faces that
were low-pass filtered, high-pass filtered, and not filtered. Participant imagery vividness 
was evaluated using the binocular rivalry paradigm of Pearson et al. (2008) as well as the 
VVIQ2 (Marks 1995).

Abstract:
Mental imagery has been characterized as the isolation of the feedback process that
occurs during normal perception, since stimuli are “perceived” without actual feedforward
sensory input. Predictive coding theory has been used to explain, among other phenomena,
visual perception and visual imagery, and the theory makes several predictions about the
phenomenological experience of visual imagery, which is most often weak and blurry when
compared with the crisp and clear experience of visual perception. Specifically, we expected
imagery strength to decrease with increasing spatial frequency, and that low-pass filtered
stimuli would allow for greater imagery strength than high-pass filtered and non-filtered
stimuli. To test these hypotheses, 16 participants completed two experiments using a
binocular rivalry paradigm. Participants’ imagery strength was operationalized as the
percentage of trials where the imagined stimulus matched the dominant stimulus during
rivalry. In Experiment 1, there were no significant differences between the imagery strength
of low, medium, and high spatial frequency stimuli. In Experiment 2, imagery strength of
low-pass filtered stimuli was not significantly different than that of high-pass filtered and
non-filtered stimuli. For both experiments, participants’ overall imagery strength was not
correlated with their total score on the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire 2
(VVIQ2). Taken together, these results show that spatial frequency and filter condition are
stimulus properties that cannot affect strength of visual imagery. The conclusions of this
study fail to verify the predictions about the nature of mental images made by the predictive
coding theory of brain function.
